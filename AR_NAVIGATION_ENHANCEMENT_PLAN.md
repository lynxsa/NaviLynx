## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// AR Scene Memory Management
class ARSceneManager {
  private scenePool: THREE.Scene[] = [];
  private materialCache: Map<string, THREE.Material> = new Map();
  private geometryCache: Map<string, THREE.Geometry> = new Map();
  
  optimizeMemory() {
    // Implement object pooling
    // Cache frequently used materials
    // Dispose unused geometries
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Frame Rate Monitoring
class ARPerformanceMonitor {
  private frameRateTarget = 60;
  private currentFrameRate = 0;
  
  monitorPerformance() {
    // Track frame rate
    // Monitor memory usage
    // Adjust quality dynamically
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Waypoint Rendering
```typescript
// Advanced 3D Waypoints
class EnhancedWaypoint {
  private model: THREE.Object3D;
  private glowEffect: THREE.ShaderMaterial;
  private distanceBasedScale: number;
  
  updateVisualization(distance: number) {
    // Scale based on distance
    // Animate glow effect
    // Update visibility
  }
}
```
