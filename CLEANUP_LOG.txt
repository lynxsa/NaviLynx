Cleanup started: Removing legacy screens and components not part of the new NaviLynx architecture.

- app/(tabs)/: Will keep only navigation stubs.
- app/chat/ and app/venue/: Will be removed.
- components/: Will keep only navigation, UI primitives, and new architecture stubs.

Scaffolding of new architecture will follow after cleanup.
