## 2. PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 2.1 Home Page Carousel (40% Complete)
- **Current State**: Basic carousel structure exists
- **Missing**: 3 additional venue slides, improved card design, CTA button actions
- **Required**: Enhanced visuals, venue-specific navigation hooks

### 2.2 Navigation Controller (70% Complete)
- **Current State**: Core navigation logic implemented
- **Issues**: Method signature mismatches with LocationService
- **Required**: API alignment, method renames, error handling

### 2.3 Indoor Navigation (60% Complete)

---

## 3. BROKEN/INCOMPLETE FEATURES ‚ùå

### 3.1 LocationService API Mismatches
**Issue**: NavigationController references methods that don't exist:
- `onLocationUpdate` ‚Üí Should be event-based listener
- `requestUserLocation` ‚Üí Verify method name/signature
- `startLocationTracking`/`stopLocationTracking` ‚Üí Check implementation
- `geocodeAddress` ‚Üí Ensure Google APIs integration
- `calculateDistance` ‚Üí Method exists but signature unclear

**Impact**: Navigation flows may fail
**Priority**: High - Required for core functionality

### 3.2 NavigationService Type Errors
**Issue**: Google Maps API unit system type mismatch
```
Type '"metric"' is not assignable to type 'UnitSystem | undefined'
```
**Impact**: Route calculation may fail
**Priority**: Medium - Fallback modes available

### 3.3 Missing API Keys
**Issue**: Gemini API key not configured in environment
**Impact**: Chat falls back to demo mode (functional but limited)
**Priority**: Medium - Demo mode provides good UX
